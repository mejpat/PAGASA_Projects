# PAGASA_Projects

Using python, I utilized the <code>requests</code> library to scrape the data from the webiste of the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration (PAGASA). This data may be used in hydrological and hydraulic modelling.

NOTE:
- The sample output for rainfall is 20210409.csv and the sample output for water level is 20210408.csv
