# PAGASA_Projects

Using python, I utilized the <code>requests</code> library to scrape data from the webiste of the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration (PAGASA). 

Two different data are scraped from the website:
1. Water level
2. Rainfall 

Rainfall and water level data are used in hydrological and hydraulic modelling.

NOTE:
- The sample output for rainfall is 20210409.csv and the sample output for water level is 20210408.csv
- The data collected in this project is not intended to be used in other projects. Some parts of the code were removed/tweaked so it won't function correctly when downloaded and ran in your machine. This is to prevent issues with PAGASA about data collection. Contact PAGASA about using their data for other purposes.
